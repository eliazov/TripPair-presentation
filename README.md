# TripPair-presentation
TripPair is a mobile application designed to connect travelers and make group travel more accessible, personal, and fun. The app was born out of a desire to solve common problems like social isolation, the difficulty of finding travel companions, and the limitations of expensive, pre-packaged group tours.

Instead of joining a rigid, pre-planned trip, TripPair empowers users to create their own custom journeys and find like-minded people to share the adventure with. It‚Äôs an alternative to traditional tour operators that puts the user‚Äôs freedom first.
### üì∞ News
TripPair is still under development, with new features being added to make the app complete and engaging.
The goal is to release it once all functionalities are ready and fully tested.
This approach ensures that users will enjoy the best possible experience while staying safe.
